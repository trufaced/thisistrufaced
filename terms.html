                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Please read the following carefully as it affects your rights. . It provides that all Disputes between you and Redefine shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and satisfactorily to the customer by contacting us at support@trufacedapp.com. This Provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between you and Redefine. For the purpose of this Provision,&nbsp;“<strong>Redefine</strong>” means Redefine and its parents, subsidiary, products, and affiliate companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, and agents.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>The term&nbsp;“<strong>Dispute</strong>”&nbsp;means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Redefine regarding any aspect of your relationship with Redefine, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision&nbsp;is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as Redefine’s licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding.</p>
                    <p><strong>We each agree that, except as provided below, any and all disputes, as defined above, whether presently in existence or based on acts or omissions in the past or in the future, will be resolved exclusively and finally by binding arbitration rather than in court in accordance with this provision</strong>, the only exception being that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.&nbsp;<strong>You acknowledge and agree that you and Redefine are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding. </strong>Further, unless both you and Redefine otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. This "Dispute Resolution" section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution: For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give Redefine an opportunity to resolve the Dispute. You must commence this process by mailing written notification to Redefine, (16192 Coastal Highway, Lewes, Delaware 19958). That written notification must include your name, your address, a written description of your Claim, and a description of the specific relief you seek. If Redefine does not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration. You may pursue your Dispute in a court only under the circumstances as discussed.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law: The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (<strong>"AAA"</strong>) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the&nbsp;<strong>"AAA Rules"</strong>) then in effect, except as modified by this "Dispute Resolution" section. (The AAA Rules are available at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.adr.org/arb_med">www.adr.org/arb_med</a>&nbsp;or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Arbitration Process: A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration and a separate form for California residents.) The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of California and will be selected by the parties from the AAA's roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Arbitration Location and Procedure: Unless you and Redefine otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and Redefine submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Arbitrator's Decision: The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator's decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator's award damages must be consistent with the terms of the "Limitation of Liability" section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys' fees and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, Redefine will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Class Action Waiver: The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and Redefine specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration. Neither you, nor any other user of the Services can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Jury Waiver: You understand and agree that by entering into this Agreement you and Redefine are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court. In the absence of this Provision, you and Redefine might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions). Except as otherwise provided above, those rights are waived. Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited or may also be waived.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Severability: If any clause within this Provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision, and the remainder of this Provision will be given full force and effect.</p>

Redefine makes no representations or warranties as to the conduct of users of the Services or their compatibility with any current or future users of the Services.

In no event shall </strong>Redefine<strong>, its affiliates or its partners be liable (directly or indirectly) for any losses or damages whatsoever, whether direct, indirect, general, special, compensatory, consequential, and/or incidental, arising out of or relating to the conduct of you or anyone else in connection with the use of the Services including, without limitation, death, bodily injury, emotional distress, and/or any other damages resulting from communications or meetings with other users or persons you meet through the </strong>Service<strong>.</strong></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Indemnity</strong></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold Redefine, its officers, directors, employees and agents, harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with your access to or use of the Services (including without limitation any Collective Content), or your violation of these Terms.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Limitation of Liability</strong></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>You acknowledge and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the Services and any collective content remains with you. Neither Redefine nor any other person or entity involved in creating, producing, or delivering the Services or collective content will be liable for any incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages, including lost profits, loss of data or loss of goodwill, Service interruption, computer damage or system failure or the cost of substitute products or Services, or for any damages for personal or bodily injury or emotional distress arising out of or in connection with these terms or from the use of or inability to use the Services or collective content, or from any communications, interactions or meetings with other users of the Services, or other persons with whom you communicate or interact as a result of your use of the Services, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), product liability or any other legal theory, and whether or not Redefine has been informed of the possibility of such damage, even if a limited remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>
                    <p>In no event will Redefine's aggregate liability arising out of or in connection with these terms or from the use of or inability to use the Services or collective content exceed the total amount actually paid by you to Redefine (if any) over the three (3) month period preceding the bringing of the applicable claim. The limitations of damages set forth above are fundamental elements of the basis of the bargain between Redefine and you. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, so the above limitation may not apply to you.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>General</strong></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>The failure of Redefine to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Redefine. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise. If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible. If any of these Terms is found to be inconsistent with applicable law, then such term shall be interpreted to reflect the intentions of the parties, and no other terms will be modified. These Terms are the entire agreement between you and Redefine and supersede all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements between you and Redefine about the Services. The proprietary rights, disclaimer of warranties, representations made by you, indemnities, limitations of liability and general provisions shall survive any termination of these Terms.</p>

Redefine will not otherwise use or exploit your User Content in a manner that identifies you individually (i.e. your name and identifying information will be removed from the applicable User Content).</p>
                    <p>By making available any user content on or through the services and by being a user, you agree that Redefine may use such user content, TruFaced Content and other Content in the manner described in these terms, including providing such content about you to third parties.

                    <p>You agree to be bound by our&nbsp;Community Guidelines. You acknowledge that anonymity comes with responsibility and therefore you acknowledge that any violation of our Community Guidelines can result in our i) deleting the inappropriate content, ii) disabling or terminating the offender's profile and, where appropriate, iii) informing the authorities. You further agree that if you see content that violates any of our Rules that have been outlined both in these Terms and be other means you will “flag” it with the appropriate flag for moderation using our flagging functionality.</p>
                    <p>You also acknowledge that we reserve the right in our sole discretion and without further notice to you, to monitor, censor, edit, remove and/or delete (in whole or in part), any and all User Content that you post on the Services at any time and for any reason (including without limitation, any User Content that violates the section below entitled&nbsp;<strong>"General Prohibitions"</strong>).</p>

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>In order to download the App, you may be required by third parties who are providing services in connection with the App, such as Apple, Inc. or Google (each, a "Service Provider"). You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of any logins, passwords, or other credentials that you select or that are provided to you to access your Profile with any Service Provider. Your access and use of any Profile with a Service Provider, including without limitation in connection with the Service, is subject to any terms, conditions, and policies, including privacy policies, of that Service Provider. We are not responsible for any act or omission of any Service Provider. We do not provide you with the equipment to access or use the Service.

                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>Submissions</strong></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>You are responsible for any information, opinions, Face Profiles, messages, comments, photos, videos, graphics, sounds and other content or material that you submit, upload, create, post or otherwise make available on or through the Services (each a&nbsp;“Submission”) and through the Services available in connection with the Services.&nbsp;We reserve the right to retain your Submissions, even after they have expired from view within the App or even after you have deleted them. However, you agree that we have no obligation to retain any Submission for any period of time, nor shall we be responsible or liable to you or any third party for any lost content or losses related to the expiration or deletion of a Submission.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>You may not upload, post, or otherwise make available on the Services any material protected by copyright, trademark, or any other proprietary right without the express permission of the owner of such copyright, trademark or other proprietary right owned by a third-party, and the burden of determining whether any material is protected by any such right is on you. You shall be solely liable for any damage resulting from any infringement of copyrights, trademarks, proprietary rights, violation of contract, privacy or publicity rights or any other harm resulting from any Submission that you make. You have full responsibility for each Submission you make, including its legality, reliability, truthfulness, and appropriateness.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>We do not confirm the real life identity or existence of any Face Profiles. It is at the User’s sole discretion and is the User’s sole responsibility to get all necessary permissions before posted any content. Unless otherwise noted, Redefine is under the impression that all Content posted and Faces represented are of a fictional nature and any likeness to real-world entities is fully coincidence.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Unless otherwise explicitly stated herein or in TruFaced Privacy Policy, you agree that any Submission provided by you in connection with the Services is provided on a non-proprietary and non-confidential basis. You hereby grant to Us a non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide license (including the right to sublicense through multiple tiers) to use, reproduce, process, adapt, publicly perform, publicly display, modify, prepare derivative works, publish, transmit and distribute each of your Submissions, or any portion thereof, in any form, medium or distribution method now known or hereafter existing, known or developed, and authorize others to use the Submissions. We may modify or adapt your Submissions in order to transmit, display or distribute them over computer networks and in various media and/or make changes to the Submissions as necessary to conform and adapt them to any requirements or limitations of any networks, devices, services or media.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Please note that the User Content (including, but not limited to, posts and Face Profiles) is based upon information provided by users and is not based on the views or input of Redefine and/or its employees.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Upon creating a Face Profile, you agree to give up any and all control over said Profile while still maintaining responsibility for the creation of said Profile. You thereby give all Users permission to post in relation to that Face Profile, and have no controls over those posts, comments on those posts, or votes placed on those posts.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>You agree to pay for all royalties, fees, damages and any other monies owing any person by reason of any Submissions posted by you to or through the Services. When you provide Submissions you agree that those Submissions shall not be in violation of the&nbsp;“Prohibited Activities”&nbsp;paragraph below.&nbsp;Those prohibitions do not require Us to monitor, police or remove any Submissions or other information submitted by you or any other user.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p><strong>General Prohibitions</strong></p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>At no point and under no circumstances is there allowed to be any content posted for Faces representative of any real-world person’s below the age of 18. Should any profiles containing such content be reported for having such content, we will immediately look into the legitimacy of the report. We will not look into or confirm if the content may represent an 18 year or older real-world person, we will only check to see if the content might possibly represents an actual person below the age of 18. If such a report is confirmed to be plausibly accurate, the content will be immediately removed and the user that posted said content will subject to possible and permanent termination from the Services, or any other courses of action deemed appropriate.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>You hereby agree that any content posted will either have no possible relation to any real-world facts, figures, individuals, groups, institutions, or any other entities that could possible be posted about, or is completely accurate and carries no falsified claims, opinions, or assumptions. Should any false information or any information that can be found to be inaccurate in any way be posted to the Services, that User fully agrees to accept all responsibility, legal or otherwise, for creating said content, and agrees that We are in no way responsible for the content that has been posted.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>You also agree not to directly or indirectly do any of the following:</p>
                    <p>Post, upload, publish, submit or transmit any Content that: (i) infringes, misappropriates or violates a third party's patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret, moral rights or other intellectual property rights, or rights of publicity or privacy; (ii) violates, or encourages any conduct that would violate, any applicable law or regulation or would give rise to civil liability; (iii) is fraudulent, false, misleading or deceptive; (iv) is defamatory, obscene, pornographic, vulgar or offensive; (v) promotes discrimination, bigotry, racism, hatred, harassment or harm against any individual or group; (vi) is violent or threatening or promotes violence or actions that are threatening to any person or entity; (vii) promotes illegal or harmful activities or substances; (viii) Post anything that exploits children or minors (including pornography that depicts minors) or that depicts cruelty to animals; or (ix) Alter the opinions or comments posted by others on the Services.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
